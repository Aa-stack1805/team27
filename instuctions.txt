DOWNLOADING JAVAFX:
1. Go to https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/ and download the correct SDK for your OS
2. Go into the download and move the javafx-sdk-23.0.1 folder into an accessible location (such as Documents)

CONFIGURING VSCODE (YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO COMMIT ANYTHING, IF YOU CAN, DO NOT COMMIT)
1. Create a folder in team27 named ".vscode"
2. Create two files in the ".vscode" folder named "launch.json" and "settings.json"
3. Copy the code below into the correct files stated
4. Replace (YOUR FILE PATH) in "launch.json" to the path of the folder you moved in the "DOWNLOADING JAVAFX" with /lib at the end
    a. Do this by finding the folder and copying the path to it in file explorer
    b. For example, my file path is this: C:/Users/kevin/OneDrive/Documents/javafx-sdk-23.0.1/lib
5. Go into the Main file and run it
